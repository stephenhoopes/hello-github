How to explain blockchain, ethereum, and cryptocurrencies to your mom. *hint...CryptoKitties

My passion for hard work and last-mile fulfillment started with my first job at age 12 as a local newspaper deliverer (i.e., a disposable book printed on paper, for those that aren't familiar). I now have 17+ years business experience with today's newspaper... the Internet.

The last decade I’ve been focused on ecommerce, mobile and last-mile. I’m going to spend the next decade (and beyond) getting involved with distributed ledgers across multiple industries. Blockchain and Ethereum are poised to standardize (displace) most business processes, technologies or industries that have a “middleman”.

I bring online and out-of-home marketing experience with retailers in apparel, health and beauty, drugstore, food/grocery and banking industries to help drive awareness and adoption for the coming "Crypto storm."
